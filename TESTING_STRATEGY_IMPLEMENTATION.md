# Testing Strategy Implementation Todo List

This document contains a detailed, comprehensive todo list to implement the Testing Strategy described in section 6.6 of TechSpecs.txt (from line ~25000 to the end). The implementation covers unit testing, integration testing, end-to-end testing, test automation, quality metrics, and specialized testing components for the Rust Actix Web REST API with JWT authentication, PostgreSQL RLS, and functional programming infrastructure.

Each item includes specific implementation steps, dependencies, and validation criteria. Mark items as complete with `- [x]` as you progress through the implementation.
